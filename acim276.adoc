
acim276 - "The Word of God is Given me to speak."
"

Father your word is mine.. speak to all your 
brothers...

Jesus comments:
Choices:
hate or love
judge or forgive
move or not move...
rise above the image of good and evil
you aer all created in the image of god.

rude and obnxious people are just errors of thought
manifesting in behavior

this is the gift u must give... 
forgive...

if u judge someone for there imperfect
 behavior... you will feel judge for your imperfect
 behavior and feel u are to be punished as well.

Forgiving is not condoning


"When u look at the world with forgiving eyes;
you stop suffering."

when u accept that people are out of order
because there minds are out of order.

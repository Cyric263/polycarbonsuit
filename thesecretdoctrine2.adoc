IV. Is Gravitation A Law? 375

1. Understanding phraseology of Occultism before criticising what it asserts….
    - The Doctrine refuses to use the words “above” and “below”, “higher” and “lower,” in reference to invisible spheres, as being without meaning.  
    - hence, when “other worlds” are mentioned- whether better or worse, more spiritual or still more materiral, though both invisible- the Occultist does not locate these spheres either outside or inside our Earth, as the theologians and the poets do; for their location is nowhere in the space known to, and conceived by, the profane.  They are, as it were, blended with our world- interpenetrating it and interpenetrating it and interpenetrated by it.  
    - Although millions of millions of worlds… they are yet with us, near us, within our own world, as objective and material to their respective inhabitants as ours is to us.  
    - The inhabitants of these, as already said, may be, for all we know, or feel, passing through and around us as if through empty space, their very habitations and countries being interblended witho urs, though not disturbing our vision, becuase we have not yet the faculties necessary for discerning them.
    - Those of the (spiritual) higher worlds, communicate only with those terrestrial mortals who ascend to them, through individual efforts, on to the higher plane they are occupying. . . .


2. The Sons of Bhumi (earth) regard the Sons of Deva-lkas (angel-spheres) as their Gods; and the Sons of Lower Kingdoms look up tothe men of Bhumi, as to their devas (gods); men remaining unaware of it in their blindnes. . . They (men) tremble before them while using them (for magical purposes)… The first race of men were the “Mind-born sons” of the former.  They (the pitris and devas) are our progenitors… (Book II, of Commentary on the Book of Dzyan.).


3. “Educated people,” so-called, deride the idea of Sylphs, Salamanders, Undines, and Gnomes; the men of science regard as an insult any mention of such superstitions; and with a contempt of logic an dcommond good sense,… let people operate under the absurd impression that in the whole Kosmos, or at any rate in our own atmosphere, there are no other conscious intelligent beings, save ourselves.  
- Society, while believing in it all secretly, is made to deride the idea openly.  It hails with mirth such works as the Count de Gabalis, and fails to understand the open satire is the securest mask.


4. Invisible worlds do exist.
- Inhabited as thickly as our own is, they are scattered throughout apparent Space in immense number; some far more material than our own world, others gradually etherealizing until they become formless and are as “Breaths.”
- Our physical eye does not see them, is no reason to disbelieve in them; physicists can see neither their ether, atoms, nor “modes of motion, or Forces.  yet they accept and teach them.


5. By denying such a possibility, Science has played for the last century into the hands of neither philosophy nor true religion, but simply into those of theology.  
- Cannot men and animals, plants and rocks, be supposed to be endowed with quite a different set of sesnes from those we possess?  Cannot their organisms be born developed, and exist, under other laws of being than those that rule our little world?  It is absolutely necessary that every corporeal being should be clothe din “coats of skin” like those that Adam and Eve were provided with the legend of Genesis?  Corporeality, we are told, however, by more than one man of science, “may exist under very different conditions.”
- Do not we know through the discoveries of that very all-denying science that we are surrounded by myriads of invisible lives?  If these microbes, bacteria and the tutti quanti of the infinitesimally small are invisible to us by virtue of their minuteness, cannot there be, at the other pole of it, beings as invisible owing to the quality of their tecture of matter- to its tenuity, in fact?  
6. When we speak, therefore, as in Book II., of men who in habited this globe 18,000,000 years back, we have in the mind neither the men of our present races, nor the present atmospheric laws, thermal conditions, etc.  The Earth and mankind, like the SUn, Moon, and planets, have all their growth, changes, developments, and gradual evolution in their life-periods; they are born, become infants, then children, adolescents, grown-up bodies, grow old, and finally die.  Why should not Mankind be also under this universal law?  Says uriel to Enoch:  “Behold, I have showed thee all things.  Thou seest the Sun, Moon, and those which conduct the stars of heaven, which caue all their operations, seasons, and arrivals to return… In the days of sinners the years shall be shortened… everything done on earth shall be subverted… the moon shallchange its laws.  et.” 

Gods, Monads, ANd Atoms XV.
     Some years ago we remakred that “the Esoteric Doctrine may well be called the “thread-doctrine” since, like Sutratman, in the Vedanta philosophy.  it passes through and strings together all the ancient philosophical religous systems
     
     and reconciles and explains them all.  We say now it does more.  It not only reconciles the various and apparently conflicting systems, but it checks the discoveries of modern exact science, and shows some of them to be necessarily correct, since they are found corroborated in the ancient records.  All this will, no doubt, be regarded as terribly impertinent and disrespectful, a veritable crime of leseScience; nevertheless, it is a fact.
     
     On the other hand, the naturalists refuse to blend physics with metaphysics, the body with its informing soul and spirit, which they prefer ignoring.  … while the minority strive very sensibly to enlarge the domain of physical science by trespassing on the forbidden grounds of metaphysics, so distateful to some materialists.
     
     Life the veil of matter…. and strain their eyes to see beyond.  Now that they have studied nature in the length, breadth, and thickness ofher physical frame, it is time to remove the skeleton to the second plane and search within the unknown depths for the living and real entity, for its sub-stsance - the noumenon of evanescent matter.
     
     it is only by acting on such lines that some of the truths, now called” exploded superstitions,” will be discovered to be facts and the relics of ancient knowledge and wisdom.
     
     One of such “degrading” beliefs- in the opinion of the all-denying sceptic- is found in the idea that Kosmos, besides its objective planetary inhabitants, its humanities in othe rinhabited worlds, is full of invisible, intelligent Existences.  
     
     The so-called Arch-Angels, Angels and SPirits, of the West, copies of their prototypes, the Dhyan-Chohans, the Devas and Pitris, of the East… are no real Beings but fictions.  On this point Materialistic Science is inexorable. . .
     
     To support its position, it upsets its own axiomatic law of uniformity in the laws of nature, that of continuity, and all the logical sequence of analogies in the evolution of being.  … the masses of the profane are asked, and made, to believe that the accumulated testimony of history, which shows even the Atheists of old such as Epicurus and Democritus - believing in gods, was false, and that philosophers lik eSocrates and Plato, asserting thei rexistence, were mistaken enthusiasts and fools.
     
     If we hold our opinions merely on historical grounds, on the authority of legions of the most eminent Sages, Neo-Platonists, Mystics of all the ages, from Pythagoras down to th eeminent Scientists and Professors of the present century, who, if they reject “gods” believe in “spirits” shall we consider such authorities as weak-minded and foolish as any Roman Catholic peasant, who believes in and prays to his once human Saint, or the Archange, St michael?
     
     Butis there no difference between the belief of the peasant and that of the Western heirs to the Rosicrucians and Alchemists of the Middle Ages?  Is it in the Van Helmonts, the Khunraths, The paracelsuses and Agrippas, from Roger Bacon down to St. Germain, who were all blind enthusiasts, hysteriacs or cheats, or is it the handful of modern sceptics, the “leaders of thought” who are struck with the cecity (blindness) of negation?
     
     The latter, we opine (express).  …
     
     The exact extend, depth, breadth, and length of the mysteries of Nature are to be found only in Eatern esoteric sciences.  So vast and so profound are these that hardly a few, a very few of the highest Initiates- those whose very existence is known but to a small number of Adepts. . . .
     
     are capable of assimilating the knowledge.  We are at the very close of the cycle of 5,000 years of the present Aryan Kaliyuga; and between this time and 1897 there will be a large rent made int he Veil of Nature, and materialistic science will recieve a death-blow.
     

-      There have been- in all ages- undeniably learned and good men who, having been reared in sectarian beliefss, died in their crystallized convictions. 
- Theophilosophy proceeds on broader lines…. the Myseries of Nature (at any rate, those which it is lawful for our races to know) were recorded by the pupiles of those same now invisible “heavenly men,” in geometrical figures and symbols.   The keys thereto passed from one generation of “wise men” to the other.  Some of the symbols thus passed from the east to the west, were brought therefrom by Pythagoras, who was not the inventor of his famous “Triangle”. The latter figure, along with the plane cube and circle, are more eloquent and scientific descriptions of the order of the evolution of the UNiverse, spiritual and psychic, as well as physical, than volumes of descriptive Cosmogonies and revealed “Geneses.”

The ten points inscribed within the “Pythagorean triangle” are worth all the theogonies and angelologies ever emanated from the theological brain. 

For he who interprets them - on their very face, and in the order given- will find in these seventeen points (the seven Mathematical Points hidden) the uninterrupted series of the genealogies of the first Heavenly to terrestrial man.  And, as they give the order of Beings , so they reveal the order in which were evolved the Kosmos, our earth, and the primordial elements by which the latter was genreated.


        “he who will master the mysteries of our Earth, will have mastered those of all others.”  

Esoteric Cosmology can be shown inseparably connected with both philosophy and modern science.  The gods of the ancients, the monads- from Pythagoras down to Leibnitz.

Monad or the mathematical Point

Unwisely rejected the Pythagoriean Monad and geometrical figures…

“Nor did the “hierogram within a Circle, or equilateral Triangle,” ever mean “the exemplification of the unity of the divine Essence”…  

     What it really meant was the triune co-equal Nature of the first differentiated Substance, or the con-substantiality of the (manifested) Spirit, matter and the Universe- their Son”… who proceeds from the Point (the real, esoteri Logos) or the Pythagorean Monad.  
     
     For the Greek Monads signifies “unity” in the primary sense.  Those unable to seize the difference between the monad- the Universal Unit- and the Monadsor the manifested Unity, as also between the ever-hidden and the revealed Logos or the Word, ought never to meddle in philosophy, let alone the Esoteric Sciences.
     
     Educated reader of Kant’s Thesis to demonstrate his second Antinomy.  Those who have read and understood it will see clearly the line we draw between the absolutely Ideal Universe and the invisible though manifested Kosmos.  Our Gods and Monads are not the Elements of extension iteself, but only those of the invisible reality which is the basis of the manifested Kosmos.  
     
     Neither esoteric philosophy, nor Kant, nor Leibnitz would ever admit that extension can be composed of simple or unextended parts.  But theologian-philosophers will not grasp this.  The circle and the point, which latter retires into and merges with the former, after having emanated the first three points and connected them with lines, thus forming the first noumenal basis of the Second Triangle in the Manifested World.
     
     On the authority of this Archaic Sybol, a male, personal god, the Creator and Father of all becomes a third-rate emanation, the Sephiroth standing fourth in descent, and ont he left hand of En-Soph (see the kabalistic tree oflife).  Heance the Monad is degraded into a Vehicle- a “throne”!
     
     The Monad- only the emanation and reflectionf ot he Point (Logos) in the phenomenal World- becomes, as th eapex of the manifested equilateral triangle, the “Father.”  The left side or line is the Duad, the Mother, regarded as the evil, counteracting principle (Plutarch, De Placitis Placitorum), the right side presents the Son (his mother’s husand…….
     
     This trancendental applicaiton of geometry to Cosmic and divine theogony- the ALpha dn the Omega of hysitcal conception…became dwarfed after Pythagoras by Aristotle.  By omitting the Point of the CIrcle, and taking no account fo the apex, he reduced the metaphysical value of the idea, and thus liited the doctrine of magnitude to simple TRIAD.  … The line, the surface, the obdy…. His modern heirs, who play at Idealism, have interprete these three geometrical figures as Space, Force, Matter….the potencies of an interacting UNity.  Materialistic Science, perceiving but the basic line of the manifested “triangle’ the plane of matter, translates it practically as Father-matter, mother-matter and son matter-, and theoretically as Matter, FOrce, COrrelation.
     
     
     
     “Space is a substantial though (apparently) an absolutely unknowable living Entity.  Such is, nevertheless, the Kabalistic teaching, and it is that of Archaic Philosophy.
     
     Space is the real world, while our world is an artificial one.  It is the One UNity throughout its infinitude; in its bottomless depths as on its illusive surface; a surface studded with countless phenomenal Universe, systems and mirage-like worlds.
     
     A Unity of Forces, there is “a connection of all matter int he plenum”.. as Leibnitz would say……
     This is symbolized in the Pythagorean Triangle.

     Metamathematics and metageometry … from indivisible Point to solid figures.  The teahcing originated in India, and was taught in Eutrope by Pythagoras….who throwing a Veil over the circle and the Point….
     
     The uathor of “New Apsects of Life and of the Kabalistic Mysteries - objects to the objectivization, so to peak, of the Pythagorean conception and use of the equilaterial triangle, and calls it amisnomer.  ….. pregenesis, and the genesis of Kosmos….
     
     Esoteric Science
     
     In the realm of the Esoteric sciences the unit divided ad infinitum, instead of losing its unity, appreaches with every division the planes of the only eternal REALITy.  The eye of the SEEr can follow and behold it in all ality of the objective universes, is found at the bottom of the Pythagorean and Platonic teachings.  
     
     Monad and the Duad
     
    
    For in the occult philosophy there are the “one Cause” and “the “Primal cause” which latter thus becomes paradoxically, the second as clearly expressed by the authoer of the “Qabbalah, from the philosophical writings of Ibn Gabirol” - 
    
    first designeded by triadic shaddai, the triune… alimighty, subsequently by the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, symbol of the Past, Present and Future, and, let us add, of the eternal Is, or the IAM….Moreover, in the Kabala the name YHVH or Jehovah expresses a He and a She, male and feamle, two in one, or Hokhmah and Binah….Shekinah ro synthesizing spirit (grace0, which makes again of the Duad and Triad.

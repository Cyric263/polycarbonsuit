Dr. Mitchell said that NASA was in the middle of the greatest renaissance in the history of science, surpassing even the understandings of relativity and quantum physis.  These theories had never quite fit together, and there were anomalies.  Einstein had searched fo rthe unified field theory that would bring all forces together in a single mathemetical formula.  Since Einstein’s time, the scientific world has been searching for this theoretical holy grail.

Now, according to Dr. Mitchel, NASA has found the answer.  he siad that NASA has learned as many facts about our physical environment in the last five years (as of Steptember 199) as civilizaiton has learned in the last 6000 years.  Further, he said that they have learned as much in the last six months as in the previous 5 years!  It is definitely exponential.  Only a mere one hundred years ago the idea of going to the Moon, as Dr. Mitchellhas so eloquently demonstrated, would have been considered absolutely impossible.  

NASA has found the unified field theory.  They feel that a great understanding has been born.  In a nutshell, they have discovered that Reality is holograpahic, that just as in a hologram, wher eyou can take a small piece of hte picture from anywhere on the image and retrieve the whole image, any physical piece of this Reality contains the image of the whole universe.  Distant star patterns can be found in a piece of your fingernail.

Even more interestingis that the inverse is also true.  That piece of fingernail can be located nto only where we find it, but also anyhwere in space.  The reality is not what we thought it was. The Eastern Indians called our reality maya, which means “illusion.”  They were right.  It is a hologram.  It is only light!




                    Thought follows attention.  Attention follows intention.


            The younger brothers, are changing to remember the ways of Great Spirit.


                        We are waking up form a 500 year old dream.



Edgar Cayce ”the sleeping prophet”, Nostradamus, The Holy Bible, Mother Mary, Yogananda and many others of the civilized world predicted that this time we live in is the time of the great change.

Some saw this time as one of great destruction and pain, with huge Earth changes and a world altered beyond recognition; others saw a time of rapid spiritual growth, a time of ascension into a new world.  Some saw both.


The indigenous peoples of the world:


1. Maori of New Zealand
2. Zulus of Africa
3. Kahunas of Hawaii
4. Eskimos of Alaska
5. May of Mexico and Guatemala
6. Kogi of OClombia
7. Native Americans of North America
8. Shintos of Japan

Are all predicting great change is now happening.


The renaissance taking place in NASA is mirrored by what is happening inside our bodies.  Deep in our DNA we are becoming new and very different.  What appear to be genetic changes in our human DNA are showing up all over the world.  What many scientist would call mutation has already occurred and, like it or not, the birthing of at least three new human races appears to be occurring at this very moment on the Earth- three very different kinds of races, filling the needs of new humanity.  The great change is definitely happening inside us, and hardly anyone knows.  It is quiet, but it is getting louder with the first breath of each newborn baby.


DNA Changes in Blood Types:
Everybody had O blood type… until 15,000 years ago… a great comet struck the Earth off the coast of Atlantis.  DNA changes do take place with seemingly innocuous changes in diet and climate.  
It was china from in 1974 that the first newly mutated child was noticed by the world.  It was a young boy who was able to “see” with his ears. Yes, he could see with his ears in the same way you ca see with your eyes- acutally, even better.  Do yhou think it is impossible? If you do, then you are in for a life-shaking surprise.

Indigo Children - traced back to 1984….As of 1999 - 80 to 90 percent of children are Indo Children.  

Lee Carroll and Jan Tober wrote books on the Indigo Children.


The Bible code:
the computer code found in the Torah.

Some reseraches of the Bible code at the Hebrew University in Israel plugged the acronym AIDS into the computer program to see what would happen.  You can read in “Cracking the Bible Code by Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.

“aids” brought forth the following words int he matrix: death, in the blood, from apes, annihilation, the the form of a virus, the HIV, the immunity, destroyed- all words ou would expect from the search term aids.  But in the matrix was also a phrase that made no sense to the BIble code reseracher in Israel, because they didnt know what was happening with aids research here in america.  In the matrix of AIDS it was clearly stated, “the end to all diseases”  I believe this new race of children will eventually make its mark on humanity in a way that will change forever the experience of being alive on Earth.

Mr. Braden mentioned the phrase “spontaneous genetic mutation”.


might be altering the DNA to superstrengthen our imnune system just as they have….

the 100th monkey theory… we can chang eour DNA to give us a superstrong immune system.


Merkaba and meditation… “intention and attention are the key to psychic abilities, placing your attention on your DNA and having the intention for it to change in the same way as these kids DNA is a definite possibility for evolutionary change.  


SuperPsychic Children…. dramatic abilities.

Omni Magazine

read every word of the page perfectly.
In Mexico City we found exactly the same ne whuman traints emerging in the children there.  There may be more, but we found over 100 children able to see with various parts of their bodies.

What is noticable is that these children can see with the same parts of the body as the Chinese do.  

Paul Dong in China’s Super Psychics, seeing with various parts of the body was the psychic ability that caught the attention of the CHinese government…. had othe Pyschic abilities as well….
then with a silent wave of her hand, the thousand rosebuds would slowly open into full bown, beautiful roses before the eyes of the astonished audience.  


Fourth-dimensional consciousness.


                            “What you think and what happens are connected.”








By the time China’s Super Psychics was released in 1997, the Chinese government had identified over 100,000 of these children.  In fact, by about 1985, the government and the Chinese scientific community simply had to admit it was true.


Uri Geller - famous psychic could bend metals - over 1500 chldren could do the same thing.




Nature Magazine in 1974 - 


Inge Bardor from Mexico seeing with her hands and feet… 


The question is, have we actually enetered the fourth dimension and recreated it to appear like the third dimension?  It does seem this way as I observe these new children.  But the truth will come out of its own accord.

Now that you know the nature of th eoriginal Reality minged with the Lucifer reality, search your own heart.  Is it true?  Look inside yourself.  Are you changing?  Are you even remotely the same person you were just a few years ago?

Life is great:
We live in a world that exists only in the mind of God.  It is only light.  Using sacred geometry, the Mother/Father spirit of life has created universe of light for us to play in and love each other.  We are the children of GOd.  Great Spirit expresses through each one of us and speaks of worlds of consciousness far above the ordinary life of humanity.  We hold within us a potential so great that if all the adjectives in the dictionary were compressed into one word, it would still not fully describe the innate greatness shinning out of the eyes of a single ordinary, everyday child.

You have a chocie.  You can continue to live life from the normal human perspective, hwhere the onyl reason for being alive is to become comforable through material things or to gain control over other human being sthrough force- or realize that the outer world is not something you appropriate, but rather an opportunity to express joy and love in your life.  The outer world and our inner world are one.

Breath deeply the pure life force into your glowing chakras and let your Mer-ka-ba live.  Open your heart fearlessly to the unknown and look with the eyes of a chlid into the eyes of God in each perosn who stands before you.  It is all so simple. 

I love you. Drunvalo

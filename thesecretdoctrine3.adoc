XI What are the Seven Planets pg 449

As well expressed by the translator of the “Crest-Jewel of Wisdom” though Iswara is “God” unchanged in the profoundest depths of pralayas and in the intensest activity of the manvantaras.  still beyond him is “Atma” round whose pavilion is the darkness of eternal MAYA.   The “triads” born under the same Parent-planet, or rather the radiations of one and the same Planetary SPirit (Dhyani Buddha) are, in all their after lives and rebirths, sister, or “twin-souls.” on this Earth.

This was known to every high initiate in every age and in every country.  “I am my Father are one,” said jesus (john x.30).  .. “I ascend to my Father and your Father,” it meant that which has just been stated.  it was simply to show that the group of his disciples and followrs attracted to Him belonged to the same Dhyani BUddha, “Star” or “Father” again of the same planetary realm and division as He did.  

It is the knowledge of htis occult doctrine that found expression in the review of “The Idyll of the White Lotus,” when Mr. T Subba Row wrote, “Every Buddha meets at his last initiation all the great adepts who reached Buddhahood during the preceding ages… every class of adepts has its own bond of spiritual communinion which knits them together…. The only possible and effectual way of entering into such brotherhood… is by bringing oneself with th einfluence of the Spiritual light which radiates from one’s own Logos.  

I may further point out here… that such communion is only possible bteween persons whos souls derive their life and sustenance from the same divine RAY, and that Seven distinct rays radiate from the “Central Spiritual Sun” al adelpts and Dhyan Chohans are divisible into seven classes, each of which is guided, controlled, and overshadoweed by one of the seven forms or manifestations of the divine Wisdom… Theosophist aug , 1886.

It is then the “Seven Sons of lIght” - called after their planets and (by the rabble) often identified with them namely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Venus, and … Sun and Moon… maybe our heavenly parents, or Father, synthetically.  …

Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus a, the four exoteric planets, and the three others, which must remain unnamed where the heavenly bodies in direct astral and psychic communication with the Earth, its Guides and Watchers.  morally and physically; the visible orbs furnishing our Humanity with its outward and inward characteristics, and their Regents or Rectors with our Monads and spiritual faculties.  In order to avoid creating new misconceptions, let it be stated that among the three secret orbs (or star-angels) neither Uranus nor Neptune entered; not only because they were unknown under these names to the ancient Sages, but because they, as all other planets, however many there may be, are the gods and guardians of other septenary chains of globes without our system.

Nor do the two last discovered great planets depend entirely on the Sun like the rest of the planets.  Otherwise, how explain the fact that Neptune receives 900 times less light than our Earth, and Uranus 390 times less, and that their satellites show a peculiarity of inverse rotation found in no other planets of the Solar System.  At any rate what we say applies to Uranus, though recently the fact beegins again to be disputed.  

This subject will, of course, be considered mere vagary by all those who confuse the universal order of being with their own systems of classification.  here, however, simple facts from Occult teachigns are stated, to be either accepted or rejected, as the case may be.  There are details which , on account of their great metaphysical abstractions, cannot be enetered upon.  Hence, we merely state that only seven of our planets are as intimately related to our glove, as the Sun is to all th ebodies subject to him in his system.  Of these bodies the poor little number of primary ad secondary planets known to astronomy, looks wretched enough, in truth.  

70 planets… connected with seventy elders of the people of Israel… because the regents of these planets are meant, not the orbs themselves, and the word seventy is aplay an da blind upon the 7 x7 of the subdivisions.  each people and nation as said already has its direct Watchr, guardian and father in Heaven, a Planetary Spirit.  l

The Planetary origin of the Monad (Soul) and of its faculties was tuaght by the Gnostics.  On its way to the Earht, as on its way back from teh Earth, each soul born in and from the “Boundless Light” had to pass through the seven planetary reigions both ways.  The pure Dyyani and Devas of the oldest religions had become, in course of tie, with the Zoroastrians, the Seven Devs, the ministers of Ahriman, “each chained to his planet” with the Brahmins, the Asuras and some of tis Rishis- good , bad and indifferent….

and among the Egyptians Hnostics it was Thoth or Hermes who was the chief of the seven whose names are given by Origen as Adonai, genius of the sun, tao of the moon, eloi, of upiter, sabao of ars, orai, of venus, astaphai, o rmercury, and ildabaoth Jehovah, of saturn.

Finally, the Pistis-Sophia, which the greatest omdern authority on exoteric Gnostic beliefs the late Mr. C.W.King refers to as “that precious monument of Gnosticism.”  

The Astral Rulers of the Spheres (the planetes0 create the monads (the Souls) from their own substance out of the tears of their eyes, and the seat of their torments,” endowing the monads with a spark of the Divine light…. which is their substance.  

It will be shown in BOok II why these “Lords of the Zodiac and Spheres” have been transformed by sectarian theology into the rebellious angels of the Christians, who took them from the Seven Devs of the Magi, without understading the significance of the allegory.  

As usual, that which is and was from its beginning divine, pure and spiritula in tits earliest unity, became by reason of its differentiation by the distorted prism of man’s conceptions, human and impure as reflecting man’s own sinful nature.

“I know ye are Abraham’s seed” I speak the thigns which I have seen with my Father, and ye do the things which ye heard from your Father… Ye do the works of your Father,… Ye are of yoru Father, the Devil… He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.  When one speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own; fo rhis father also is aliar and the father thereof, et etc.

Threatened with hell-fire anyone who says ismply raca (fool) to his brother matthew v, 22).  And evidently, again, the planets are not mrely spheres, twinkling in Space, and made to shine for no purpose, but the domains of various beings  with whom the profane are so far unacquainted; nevertheless, having a ysterious, unbroken, and powerful connection with men and globes.  Every heavenly body is the temple of GOd, and these gods themselves are the temples of GOd , the Unkonwn “Not Spirit.”  There is nothing profane in the Universe.  All Nature is a consecrated place, a sYoug says.

“each of these Stars is a religious house.”. . . .

Thus can all exoteric religions be shown the falsified copies of the esoteric teachings.  It is the priesthood which has to be held responsible fo rthe reaction in favour of materialism o four day.  It is by worshiping and enforcing on the masses the worship of the shells- personified for purpose of allegory- of pagan ideals, that the latest exoteric religion has made of Western lands a Pandemonium, in which the higher classes worship the golden calf, and the lower and ignorant masses are mad eto worship an idol with feet of clay.

Secret Sciences

Cosmogony and primeval matter…the whole foundation belong sto Grecian and Indian rchaic astronomy and physics, in those days always called philosophy.  


Homoiomeria is now called Primitive fluid by SIr W. Thomson.  The Hindu and Greek Atomosts- Kanada, Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, … atopic theory of our modern days…. Leibnitz monads and ending with Vertical Atoms  of SIr W. Thomson.  


        “Light from its metaphysical aspect was fully treated of in “Isis Unveiled”

“Light is the first begotten , and the first emanation of the Supreme, and Light is Life, says the Evangelist and the Kabalist.  Both are electricity- the life principle of the anima mundi, pervading theuniverse, the electric vivifier of all things.  

Light is the great Protean Magician, and under the divine will of the architect, or rather the architects, the BUilders called “One collectively), its multifavrious omnipotent waves gave birth to every form as well as to every living being.  

From its swelling electric bosom, spring matter and spirit.  Within its beams lie the beginnings of all physical and chemical action, and of all cosmic and spiritual phenomena; it vitalizes and disorganizes it gives life and produces death, and from its primordial point gradually emerged into existence the myriads of worlds, visible and invisible celestial bodies.  

It was at the ray of this FIrst mother, one in three, which is not cause of either light or heat, but merely the focus, or as we might say, the lens, by which ther ays of the primordial light become materialized, are concentrated upon our SOlar system and produce all the correlations of forces.

This is the Ether, as just explained int he views of Metcalfe, repeated by Dr. Richardson…. But Occultists are by no means the only heretics in this respect; for Mr. Robert Hunt, FRS remarks in his Researches on Light in tits Chemical Relations.. that:

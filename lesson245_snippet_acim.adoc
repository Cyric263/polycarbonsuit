<p>Lesson 245</p>

<p>
"Your peace is with me, Father. I am safe."
</p>

<p>Your peace surrounds me, Father.  Where I go, Your peace goes there with me.  It sheds its light on everyone I meet.  I bring it to the desolate and lonely and afraid.  I give You peace to those who suffer pain, or grieve for loss, or think they are bereft of hope and happiness.  Send them to me, my Father.  Let me bring Your peace with me.  For I would save Your Son, as is Your Will, that I may come to recognize my Self."

<p>And so we go in peace.  To all the world we give the message that we have received.  And thus we come to hear the Voice for God, Who speaks to us as we relate His Word; Whose Love we recognize because we share the Word hat He has given unto us."

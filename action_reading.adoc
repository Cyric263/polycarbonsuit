* Re-interpret each card as a possible recommendation for action to empower the person to action.

* As Ideas Occur Write them down.

"_*A healthy plea for help is not an effort to transfer control or responsibility to the Reader.*_

1. Strengths: X, Y, Z

2. Resources: X, Y, Z

3. Insights:  X, Y, Z

Leaving them some action statements so they can help him or herself.

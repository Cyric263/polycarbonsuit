and nothing can intrude on the peace that god himself has given to
his son.

1. your peace is mine.
2. i can not lose your gifts to me.
3. 

Jesus Comments:

Beginning to see, you have a choice whether or not u get upst or not.

 go inside and say what is it in me that is upset?
once the mind is oppsessed with someone elses guilt you are in 
the egos playground.

what u are blaming or seeing someone else as guilty u have decended 
into the battleground, down your ladder!  [" Stay high on your ladder
 of peace love and joy! "] - Jesus (#483) ACIM Lesson #273

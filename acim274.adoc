Lesson 274 - "Today belongs to LOVE; Let me not fear!"

Love of brother to his brother to his friend.
Light will replace all darkness.

Jesus Comments:
1. you do not realize your resistance to life and jdugement cause fear.
2. you are literally argueing with god when u are judging what is
around you or judging yourself.

3. what u are saying is, what is, should not be; and that 
creates fear int he mind.

4. part of the mind knows that u are arguing with God.

5. "what is, is." u can not change what is currently manifsting u
 would be far better served.. this is something i do nto want to 
keep gasing on.. and look on what i do want to gase upon.

6. invest your love and patien in something that is good for the
planet.

7. and watch everying calm down and watch your fears disappear.
